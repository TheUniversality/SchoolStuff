# Heya!
This is just a repository of *random* scripts & projects I did in school or at home as a way of practise.

(Some projects _**C# WPF** especially_ may require you to install them, since these projects don't have **certificates**, expect your Windows _(or other OS)_ screaming at you as it considers an unsafe program.)

## C# : WPF
[TennisCalculator](https://github.com/TheUniversality/SchoolStuff/blob/main/CSharp/WPF/TennisCalculator/DLink.md)

## C# : Avalonia UI
[API Thingy](https://github.com/TheUniversality/SchoolStuff/blob/main/CSharp/AvaloniaUI/API_Thingy/DLink.md)
